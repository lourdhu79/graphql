# (Odyssey Course) Getting started with MCP and GraphQL

Welcome to the starter code for **Getting started with MCP and GraphQL**. You can find the [course lessons and instructions](https://apollographql.com/tutorials/intro-mcp-graphql) on Odyssey, [Apollo](https://apollographql.com)'s learning platform.

Inside of this repo you'll find one directory, `operations`, and a configuration file, `supergraph.yaml`.

- Throughout the course, we'll define various GraphQL operations within the `operations` directory. To start, it's empty!
- We'll use the `supergraph.yaml` file to boot up a local router process with `rover dev`. Our API is ready to run with one service from the start (`listings`), so you don't need to do any additional configuration to get up and running.

## Prerequisites

To run this repository, you'll need Node and a terminal. You should be familiar with GraphQL basics (including Schema Definition Language), as well as client-server communication.

We'll take care of installing the other tools you'll need throughout the course, including Claude (our AI assistant) and Rover (Apollo's official command line interface for interacting with GraphOS).
